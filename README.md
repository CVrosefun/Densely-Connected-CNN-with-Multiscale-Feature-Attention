Densely Connected CNN with Multi-scale Feature Attention for Text Classification

## Introduction
**Densely Connected CNN with Multi-scale Feature Attention for Text Classification** is initially described in an [IJCAI-ECAI 2018 paper](https://wangshy31.github.io/papers/1-Densely_Connected_CNN_with_Multiscale_Feature_Attention.pdf). It provides a new CNN architecture to produce variable n-gram features. It is worth nothing that:

* It uses dense connections to build short-cut paths between upstream and downstream convolutional blocks, which enable the model to compose features of larger scale from those of smaller scale, and thus produce variable n-gram features.
* A multi-scale feature attention is developed to adaptively select multi-scale features for classification.
* It obtains competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines on six benchmark datasets.
